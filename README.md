# Miko CLI - Task Manager in Go

Miko is a simple command-line application written in Go for managing your tasks. It allows you to add, list, complete, and delete tasks, and saves all your data in a JSON file (tasks.json) for persistence.

## Features :

* Add tasks: Quickly add new tasks with a title.

* List tasks: See all tasks with their status (completed or not).

* Mark tasks as done: Update the status of tasks to completed.

* Delete tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need.

* Persistent storage: Tasks are stored in tasks.json so they remain between sessions.
